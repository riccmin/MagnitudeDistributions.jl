## Request new features

1. Make sure that the feature falls within the scope of the package (read 
   [README.md](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/blob/main/README.md)).

2. Search existing [discussions](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/discussions) to 
   see if somone else has already proposed the same feature.
   Also check existing [issues](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/issues) and 
   [projects](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/projects) to see if the feature is 
   already planned to be implemented.  

3. Open a discussion (category `Ideas`) providing if possible the following information about 
   the feature: 
    - a summary of how it works; 
    - the reasons why it is useful to you and to other users;
    - the most relevant references;
    - links to other programs/packages that already implement it.


If you are familiar with the theory behind the feature, consider implementig it yourself 
(see [contributing.md](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/blob/main/community/contribute/gitcontrib/contributing.md) 
for more information), regardless of your coding experince.
