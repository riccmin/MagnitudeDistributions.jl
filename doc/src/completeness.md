# Magnitude of completeness

!!! note

    `maxcurv`, `mbass` and `mbs` are based on magnitudes grouped into bins of width ``ΔM``. 
    As a result, the estimated magnitude of completeness ``M_{c}`` corresponds to 
    the center of one of the bins. To obtain the effective magnitude of completeness ``M_{0}``, 
    it is then necessary to substract from ``M_{c}`` half bin width: ``M_{0} = M_{c} - ΔM/2``
