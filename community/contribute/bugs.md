## Bug report

1. Make sure the problem is caused by MagnitudeDistributions rather than another Julia package.

2. Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/issues) to see if someone else has already noticed the same problem.

3. Open an issue providing if possible:
  - a [minimal working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example);
  - the full error message;
  - The version of MagnitudeDistributions as provided by the `Pkg.status("MagnitudeDistributions")` command;

When pasting code blocks or output, put triple backquotes (\`\`\`) around the text so GitHub will format it nicely. Code statements should be surrounded by single backquotes (\`). See [GitHub's guide on Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) for more information.
