## Ask for support 

1. Make sure that your problem is caused by MagnitudeDistributions and not by other julia packages.

2. If the problem is a bug, consider filing a [bug report](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/blob/main/community/contribute/bugs.md) instead.

2. Search the existing [discussions](https://github.com/riccmin/MagnitudeDistributions.jl/discussions) to see if someone else has already asked the same question.

3. Open a discussion (category `Q&A`) providing if possible:
    - a brief summary of what you are attempting to do and of the problem you are facing;
    - a [minimal working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example);
    - the output or the full error message you get.

4. If your question is answered correctly, consider marking the best post as answer. 

When pasting code blocks or output, put triple backquotes (\`\`\`) around the text so GitHub will format it nicely. Code statements should be surrounded by single backquotes (\`). See [GitHub's guide on Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) for more information.
